|  | 11 | T | System connects to laptop without wired connection | T/F |  |
| Feedback | 12 | O | Have external light to indicate Myrio power | T/F |  |
|  | 13 | T | System should alert user when contact is made with probe during measurement. | T/F |  |
| Weight/Dimensions | 14 | 0 | Touch probe weight | 1 | lb |
|  | 15 | O | Touch probe width/length | $(4,6)$ | inch |
|  | 16 | O | Touch probe length | $(4,6)$ | inch |
|  | 17 | O | Probe travel distance | $<10$ | inch |
| Power | 18 | T | Prototype shall operate for 1 hour without the need to change batteries | 1 | hour |
|  | 19 | O | Prototype shall have "idle" mode which can run without significant power loss. | T/F |  |
|  | 20 | O | Prototype shall operate for 4 hours without the need to change batteries | $4+$ | hour |
| Quality Control <br> (mandatory) | 21 | T | Number of system bugs detected upon prototype demonstration | $<5$ | bugs |
|  | 22 | O | Number of system bugs detected upon prototype demonstration | 0 | bugs |
|  | 23 | T | Project professionalism (are wires hanging out? duct tape used? Electrical tape on <br> wires vs. heat-shrink? etc.) | Scale: $1-10$ |  |
| Project requirements <br> (mandatory) | 24 | T | Prototype uses LabVIEW | T/F |  |
|  | 25 | T | Prototype uses the myRIO | T/F |  |
|  | 26 | T | Prototype uses $2+$ actors | T/F |  |
|  | 27 | O | Prototype uses at minimum 2 actors to perform meaningful, complex system <br> interactions (i.e. not just using an actor based of a single, simple, sensor data). An <br> example: basic interaction is a single LED indicating prototype is ON/OFF, vs. <br> meaningful interaction is an RGB LED using color to indicate temperature of coffee <br> using a thermocouple. | T/F |  |
